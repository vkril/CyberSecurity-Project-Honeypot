# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and provide a working demonstration of its features.

  <b>Which Honeypot(s) you deployed</b>
  
  I used MHN: Deploying a Honeypot Sensor tools, to create the scripts for attack. Created the script through the admin website in the Deploy category and each script I used in the terminal to make attack attacking. This is the following attacks that I used to attack:
  * The following listen on port 80, and only one should run on the same sensor, unless different ports are configured:
      - wordpot
  * The following listen on windows ports 445, 139, etc. Chose one or modify to listen on different ports:
      - Dionea
  * These can be run with each other and any of the others (no port conflicts):
      - kippo
      - snort
      - suricata
      - p0f
      - elastichoney
   
  For each of this created seperated script
